#### Talent Acquisition Specialist (Contract)

[**A Cloud Guru**](https://acloud.guru), *Melbourne ‚Äì October 2020 to December 2020*

A short contract role in which I owned six roles across engineering and design, from sourcing, interviewing, and candidate management to final offer.

Achievements:

[**Automattic**](https://automattic.com), *Remote ‚Äì February 2018 to February 2020*

I was brought in as the first dedicated recruiter, and to own the hiring process end-to-end for software engineers (PHP/JavaScript, iOS, Android).

Achievements:

Achievements:
