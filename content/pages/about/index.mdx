![It's me again!](lnd_031a7a5b-2adb-4db8-b84d-605a2a9b5f9e-1.jpg)

I‚Äôm a people ops leader, technical recruiter, developer, technology enthusiast, coffee lover and dad from Melbourne, Australia. I became a developer in 2007, made the shift to technical recruitment in 2016, and have recently moved into People Ops. I love helping people achieve their goals and dreams, and I take pride in building great teams.
