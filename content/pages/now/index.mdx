## Listening

The Stone Roses' [first album](https://music.apple.com/au/album/the-stone-roses-remastered/322969529).

## Watching

Loving [The Stand](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1831804/) and [WandaVision](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140560/). No chance to get into [The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854) season 5 or [Letterkenny](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4647692/) season 9, since school holidays means not much time for adult television. Five more days...

## Eating & Drinking

Eating a lot of garbage, still loving Holgate's [Love All](https://www.blackheartsandsparrows.com.au/products/75248/holgate-love-all-non-alcoholic-pale-ale-6pk).
