## Recap
### January

| | |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![Miss Scarlett](scarlett.png) | ![On the Taronga Zoo ferry](ferry.png) |

Feasted. Took a week off work and thought about moving house again (we didn’t, phew). [Welcomed Cameron to Lookahead](https://twitter.com/tcn33/status/953481303420121089) and then gave notice later the same week. Took Josie on her first ever plane trip.

### February

| | |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![Goodbye Lookahead!](goodbye.png) | ![Mmm, key lime pie](sookie.png) |

Indulged in [glorious schadenfreude](https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/960348596657971201). Said goodbye to my friends and started my [new job](https://automattic.com), after a ten-week interview process in which I interacted with people only via Slack. (This is [completely intentional](https://hbr.org/2014/01/hire-by-auditions-not-resumes), and is how I interview and hire people today.) Played a *lot* of [Alto’s Odyssey](https://altosodyssey.com). Ate some pie.

### March

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Swag](swag.png) | ![A light dinner](dinner.png) | ![Myeongdong](myeong.png) |
| ![So do we panic...?](panic.png) | ![Seoul Tower](tower.png) | ![A tattoo parlour, apparently](assteeth.png) |

Went on my first Automattic work trip, to Seoul. Walked up and down a lot of hills, ate a lot of good food, got to know my teammates, got a mysterious and potentially horrifying emergency alert text, met some local wildlife, admired some business names, ate a Crunchwrap. Came home and slept.

![Alex at Scienceworks](wink.png)

Feasted again. Took Alex to [Scienceworks](https://museumsvictoria.com.au/scienceworks/) for a fun afternoon. Watched some baseball. [Eliminated retweets](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2018/03/how-to-disable-all-retweets-on-twitter/) from my Twitter timeline and never looked back.

### May

![Werewolf](wolf2.png) ![Brisbane sunshine](bne2.png)

[The most wonderful time of the year](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23SBSEurovision%20from%3Atcn33%20since%3A2018-05-01%20until%3A2018-05-31&src=typd). Also, [Rails Camp](https://medium.com/@nimmoking/should-you-go-to-rails-camp-fa5d2d9a4129)!

![Sorry Vienna, I had...](bad.png)

RIP, Tony. MEL-HKG-MUC-BEG, nine-hour layover in Munich. On to Belgrade for WordCamp Europe. First WordCamp, first time in Eastern Europe, loved it. BEG-VIE-HKG-MEL, 9-hour layovers in Vienna and Hong Kong on the way back.

### July

![😆](problems.png) [![Click to embiggen](pano_th.png)](/pano.png)

Recovered. WordCamp Sydney. Chaperoned 60 first-graders to a children’s farm (shudder). Spent a night on Philip Island.

### August

![It me](coffee2.png)  ![Crazy girls ❤️](girls.png)

[Deactivated my Twitter](https://twitter.com/tcn33/status/1029689636417761281). Celebrated birthdays with my girls.

### September
![](camaro.png) ![](nasa.png) 

Reactivated Twitter, though not before deleting 85% of my history. Turned 44. Visited the US for the first time in 12 years. Drove an awesome Camaro, visited [Kennedy Space Center](https://kennedyspacecenter.com).

### October

![](ubernom.png) ![](flatirons.png)

Spent a week with all my work peeps in Orlando, had a fantastic time. They closed Diagon Alley for us! ❤️ Stopped by Denver on the way home and saw lots of people for the first time in ages. Visited the Sunshine State for WordCamp Brisbane.

### November

More [Rails Camp](/awooooo-🐺). First visit to Tasmania since I was 2, loved it. Not much else, Rails Camp consumed my life (and [Caitlin’s](https://twitter.com/CaitlinPB)!) most of the month.

Started the [Focus Course](https://thefocuscourse.com). MEL-LAX-ORD-BNA. WordCamp US, loved it. Ate [both](/so-good) [kinds](/so-so-good) of Nashville hot chicken, lots of biscuits and gravy. BNA-IAH-CUN. DevEx meetup in Tulum, minus a Matías (sabbatical) but plus a Cate (six-month rotation). Got lots done, super productive. Good food, cooking class, ziplining, swimming in cenotes, highly recommended. CUN-LAX-MEL, came within four minutes of finding out what happens when you miss your international flight due to customs taking forever 🙄 Xmas, family, love. Sleep.
