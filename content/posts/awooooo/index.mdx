Rails Camps are one of my favourite things, which explains why this most recent one was my seventh in three-ish years, and the second I‚Äôve co-organised.

There‚Äôs just something about getting away from civilisation, spending some time with good humans, hacking away on a project, and playing Werewolf all night.

This time around I even gave a talk, which was received well enough that I‚Äôm going to give it some polish and see what happens.

Ruby Australia has its general meeting and elections at Rails Camps, and this one marked the end of my tenure as President. I wish the new committee all the best and know they‚Äôll do an amazing job.

And now, to sleep.
